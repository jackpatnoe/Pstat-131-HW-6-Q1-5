## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

![Fig 1. Houndoom, a Dark/Fire-type canine Pokémon from Generation II.](images/houndoom.jpg){width="200"}

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.


```{r}
# Using same code from hw 5

# Cleaning using janitor: 

library(janitor)
Pokemon <- Pokemon %>%
  clean_names

# Filtering out rarer pokemon: 

Pokemon <- Pokemon %>% filter(type_1 == "Bug" |
                                type_1 == "Fire" |
                                type_1 == "Grass" |
                                type_1 == "Normal" |
                                type_1 == "Water" |
                                type_1 == "Psychic")

#Converting type 1, legendary, and generation to factors: 


Pokemon$type_1 <- as.factor(Pokemon$type_1)
Pokemon$legendary <- as.factor(Pokemon$legendary)
Pokemon$generation <- as.factor(Pokemon$generation)

# Creating our initial split: 

set.seed(1000)
Pokemon_split <- initial_split(Pokemon, 
                               prop = 0.8, strata = type_1)
Pokemon_training <- training(Pokemon_split)
Pokemon_testing <- testing(Pokemon_split)

# Doing our vfold: 

Pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(Pokemon_training, v = 5, strata = type_1)


# Creating our recipe: 

Pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def, data = Pokemon) %>% 
  
  step_dummy(legendary, generation) %>%
  
  step_center(starts_with("legendary"), starts_with("generation"), sp_atk, attack, speed, defense, hp, sp_def) %>% 
  
  step_scale(starts_with("legendary"), starts_with("generation"), sp_atk, attack, speed, defense, hp, sp_def)


```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?


```{r}

# Creating our correlation matrix: 

Pokemon1 <- Pokemon %>%
  select(total, hp, attack, defense, sp_atk, sp_def, speed)
Pokemon_Corr <- cor(Pokemon1)
Pokemon_CorrMatrix <- corrplot(Pokemon_Corr, type = "lower", diag = FALSE,  method = "color")

```
The relationship here that stands out is the the total has a strong correlation with all of the other variables. This is because if a Pokemon is a strong pokemon and has an elite attack or defense, they will most likely also have a higer sp_atk, sp_def, and speed. 

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?


```{r}

# Setting up decision tree model

tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")
Pokemon_Tree <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("classification")

# Setting up workflow 

Pokemon_Tree_Wkflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(Pokemon_Tree %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(Pokemon_recipe)

# Optimizing Roc_auc and with our range (-3,1)

Pokemon_fold <- vfold_cv(Pokemon_trainining)
Pokemon_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)
pokemon_TuneRes <- tune_grid(
  Pokemon_Tree_Wkflow, 
  resamples = Pokemon_fold, 
  grid = Pokemon_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
autoplot(pokemon_TuneRes)

```
Taking a look at this graph, we can say a single decision tree is better with a lower cost complexity parameter. As cost-complexity parameter increases we see a sharp decline in Roc_auc. 


### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*


```{r}

# Using hints we can find roc_auc of the best performing pruned decision tree on the folds: 

Pokemon_Best <- collect_metrics(pokemon_TuneRes)
arrange(Pokemon_Best, desc(mean))

Pokemon_BestROCAUC <- collect_metrics(pokemon_TuneRes) %>%
  select(-1) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean)) %>%
  filter(row_number()==1)
Pokemon_BestROCAUC


```
Looking at the data, the Roc_AUC of the best performing pruned decision tree is .6101733

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.


```{r}

# Visualizing this: 

install.packages("rpart.plot")
library(rpart.plot)


Pokemon_BestVisualize <- select_best(pokemon_TuneRes)
Pokemon_Tree_Best <- finalize_workflow(Pokemon_Tree_Wkflow, Pokemon_BestVisualize)
Fit_Pokemon_Best <- fit(Pokemon_Tree_Best, data = Pokemon_training)
Fit_Pokemon_Best %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()


```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**


```{r}

# Setting up random forecast model & Wkflow using rand_forest

Pokemon_RfSpec <- rand_forest(mtry = tune(), trees = tune(), min_n = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("randomForest", importance = TRUE) %>%
  set_mode("classification")

# Workflow: 

Pokemon_RfWkflw <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(Pokemon_RfSpec) %>%
  add_recipe(Pokemon_recipe)

# Setting up grid: 

Pokemon_RfGrid <- grid_regular(mtry(range = c(1,8)),
                                trees(range = c(1,10)),
                                min_n(range = c(1,10)),
                                levels = 8)

# Displaying grid: 

Pokemon_RfGrid




```
The Mtry parameter is the number of predictors that are given to a tree for a decision to be made. The Trees parameter is the number of different trees in a given model. Min_n will be the smallest amount of additional values we need to have another split (Minimal node size).

The reason Mtry should not be smaller than one or larger than eight is because we need it to be within the amount of predictors we define in our recipe, which is eight total. If it were to be 8 exactly, this means that given model uses all of the predictors. If it is 0, it means it uses none, which is why it has to be at least 1. 


### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}

library(randomForest)

library(randomForestExplainer)

```

```{r}

```
### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?


```{r}




```
### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

What do you observe?

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?
